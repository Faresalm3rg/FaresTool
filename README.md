# FaresTool

**FaresTool** is a lightweight console utility that simplifies the process of downloading Steam manifest and Lua files using the fares.top Manifest Downloader. Due to recent issues with the latest Steam update and SteamTool not correctly handling new game additions, FaresTool provides a workaround by allowing you to fetch the necessary `.lua` and `.manifest` files directly through the tool.

## Features

- Easily add games to Steam using FaresTool [.lua and .manifest files]
- Simple and clean interface with minimal setup
- Bypasses current bugs in the latest Steam version

## Requirements
- Steam installed and running
- SteamTool (installed but not necessarily fully functional) 

## How It Works
FaresTool allows you to Drag and Drop to its icon, and then automatically handles the placement of the necessary configuration files.

## How to Use
1- Launch FaresTool
2-Drag and Drop .lua and .manifest to FaresTool icon

## Notes
- This tool is intended as a temporary workaround until SteamTool is updated or fixed.
- Use at your own discretion; no files from Steam or your system are permanently modified.
